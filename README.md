# Pick-a-pic - a simple camera roll selector. 
Using the `UIImagePickerController` class along with `UINavigationControllerDelegate` and `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`, make a simple screen that allows you to select a photo from you camera roll and display it in an image view. Use the following gif as a reference.

This part of the homework is a single file. You simply need to create a `UIImagePickerController` and configure it to show the camera roll. By implementing the `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate` methods, you will receive information from the `UIImagePickerController`, including the selected image.
